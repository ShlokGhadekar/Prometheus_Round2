Task 1: Ball Detection Dataset and Model Training

1. Dataset Creation
	•	Roboflow Dataset Generation:
	•	The Ball Detection dataset was created using Roboflow, where 20 images were annotated with bounding boxes around the balls.
	•	The dataset was split into training (13 images) and validation (4 images) sets.
	•	The dataset was exported in the YOLOv8 format, containing both images and their corresponding annotation files.
	•	Exporting the Dataset:
	•	After annotation, the dataset was exported in the YOLOv8 format, which is suitable for training object detection models. Each image has a corresponding .txt file with the annotation (class, x_center, y_center, width, height).

2. Model Training
	•	Environment Setup:
	•	Google Colab was used to train the model with GPU support, providing the necessary environment for efficient model training.
	•	YOLOv8 Setup:
	•	The YOLOv8 model was chosen due to its efficiency and high performance in real-time object detection tasks.
	•	Training Configuration:
	•	The model was trained using the training set, with the YOLOv8 framework handling data loading, model configuration, and optimization through the Adam optimizer.

3. Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
	•	Metrics:
	•	Key metrics like Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU) were monitored during training to assess model performance.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning:
	•	Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs were adjusted to optimize the model’s accuracy.

4. Inference and Testing
	•	Model Inference:
	•	After training, the model was tested on new, unseen images to predict the location of the ball using bounding boxes.
	•	Prediction Results:
	•	The model successfully detected balls in test images, demonstrating its ability to generalize to new data.

5. Model Deployment
	•	Model Saving:
	•	The trained model was saved in a standard format (.pt for PyTorch models), allowing it to be reused for further testing or deployment.
	•	Download and Usage:
	•	The saved model file was downloaded for future use, enabling its application in real-time ball detection.

6. Future Improvements
	•	Dataset Expansion:
	•	Expanding the dataset with more images and annotations will enhance model performance.
	•	Data Augmentation:
	•	Techniques like flipping, rotation, and scaling could be applied to the dataset to increase its diversity.
	•	Hyperparameter Tuning:
	•	Further fine-tuning of hyperparameters will improve model accuracy and robustness.

Task 2: Player Rating Prediction

Methodology and Findings

1. Data Exploration
	•	Dataset Overview:
	•	The data was sourced from the European Soccer Database, with a focus on the Player_Attributes table, which contains information about players, including their attributes and ratings.
	•	Data Exploration Process:
	•	The first step was to check the structure of the data and identify any missing or duplicate values.
	•	Basic statistics were calculated for key variables such as player ratings, potential, and physical attributes (e.g., height, weight).

2. Visualizations
	•	Age Distribution:
	•	A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of player ages. It helped to analyze whether younger or older players tend to have higher ratings.
	•	Rating Distribution:
	•	A histogram was also used to visualize how player ratings are distributed, revealing whether the ratings are skewed or evenly spread.
	•	Correlation Heatmap:
	•	A correlation heatmap was generated to identify relationships between various player attributes, such as passing, dribbling, and shooting. This helped in understanding which features are most influential in predicting player ratings.

Machine Learning Part: Player Rating Prediction

Feature Selection Justification

The features chosen for predicting player ratings were selected based on their relevance to a player’s performance:
	•	Age: Age is often associated with experience and peak physical performance, impacting player ratings.
	•	Height and Weight: Physical attributes play a role in a player’s performance, influencing aspects like balance, stamina, and strength.
	•	Value: The market value of a player can be an indicator of their skill and performance.

Model Choice Explanation

A Linear Regression model was chosen for this prediction task:
	•	Simplicity: Linear regression is a simple yet effective method for regression tasks where relationships between variables are assumed to be linear.
	•	Interpretability: Linear regression offers clear coefficients, making it easy to understand the influence of different features on the player rating.

Basic Performance Metrics
	•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.58 – The predicted ratings were, on average, off by 1.58 points from the actual ratings.
	•	R-squared (R²): 0.47 – The model explained 46.6% of the variance in player ratings, indicating that while the model performs well, there’s still room for improvement.

Conclusion

Task 1: Ball Detection Model
	•	The ball detection model successfully identified balls in images using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. Although the dataset was limited, the model performed well and can be improved with more data and hyperparameter tuning.

Task 2: Player Rating Prediction
	•	The linear regression model for predicting player ratings showed reasonable performance with a MAE of 1.58 and an R² of 0.47. Future improvements can be made by adding more features or trying more complex models.

Both tasks demonstrate the potential for leveraging machine learning in the field of soccer analytics, and there are opportunities to enhance these models through data expansion and feature engineering.
